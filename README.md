# 🎲 Datos Party — CE-1103 

## 📘 Overview

**Datos Party** is a board game-style project developed for the course CE1103 — Algoritmos y Estructuras de Datos I at Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. It is inspired by the gameplay mechanics of Mario Party, where 2 to 4 players compete by moving through a board, collecting coins, playing minigames, and purchasing stars to win.

Unlike the original Mario Party, this version emphasizes data structure implementation. The project integrates several custom list types to handle game state, player progression, and event systems.
